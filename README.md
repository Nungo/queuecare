QueueCare - Smart Patient Management for Primary Healthcare
Clinics
Project Overview
QueueCare is an offline-first patient and queue management system designed specifically for South
African primary healthcare clinics. The system addresses critical healthcare challenges including
operational costs, access disparities, and the need for patient-centric solutions in under-resourced
settings.
Problem Statement
South African healthcare faces significant challenges:
84% of South Africans depend on public healthcare with only 30% of physicians servicing this sector
Annual per capita expenditure ranges from USD 1,400 in private sector to USD 140 in public sector
Private healthcare patients enjoy seamless record sharing while public healthcare patients lack
continuity of care
Many clinics operate with paper-based systems and limited digital infrastructure
Long waiting times and overcrowded facilities are common
Solution
QueueCare bridges the healthcare data divide by providing:
Offline-first patient management that works without internet connectivity
Caregiver-linked family profiles for managing multiple patients
Portable patient records through QR code technology
Multilingual interface supporting South African languages
Real-time queue management with priority handling
Health literacy-focused design for diverse populations
